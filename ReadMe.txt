פאיכ calc_*** - functions for solving differential equation

פאיכ geom_*** - functions for creating and working with geom. models.

cut - material cutting function.

main_*** - programs for process modeling.

main_const - program for modeling with forces constant at a step by time.

main_lin - program for simulating linear forces at a step by time (without iterative refinement).

main_iter - a program for simulating linear forces at a step by time (with iterative refinement).

main_iter_DOF1 - the same, but with only one degree of freedom.

main_iter_puankaracii - a function that returns the resulting simulation 
	dynamic displacements, which are then used to construct punching lines.

main_iter_puankaracii_8 - the same, but with a cut depth of cut = 8 feeds.

main_iter_puankaracii_1DOF - the same, but with one degree of freedom.

main_iter_puankaracii_1DOF_8 - the same, but with a depth of cut of 8 feeds.

puank - is the main program for building Puankare plots.
